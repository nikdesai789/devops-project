The Airline Reservation System is a software application designed to manage airline ticket booking and flight operations efficiently. This system allows users to search for flights, book tickets, manage passenger details, and view booking history. It also provides administrative functionalities to manage flights, schedules, and reservations.

This project demonstrates the implementation of real-world airline booking workflows using modern software development practices.
